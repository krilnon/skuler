Skuler
======

Simple, web-based sketching app using swappable Kuler themes/palettes/swatches. 

This was made to test an idea about restricting a drawing to a limited set of colors.


TODO
----

- Kuler themes supported, but need to make swappable
- New document button
- Load/Save button
- Undo/Redo
- Keyboard shortcuts
- :grey_question: Load .ASE button (not just drag and drop)
- :grey_question: Change brush size


Known Issues
------------

- Color triangle doesn't register when interaction moves off the visible area of the triangle.  Probably won't fix
